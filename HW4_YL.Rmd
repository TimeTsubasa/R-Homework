## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
library(readr)
cities1 <- read_csv("cities1.csv")
library(cluster)
library(ggplot2)
library(factoextra)
str(cities1)

#Q1 Find the number of K
# delete two columns 
drop <- c("Metropolitan_Area","Crime_Trend","Unemployment_Threat")
df_new = cities1[,!(names(cities1) %in% drop)]
df_new
# scale dataframe
df1 <-scale(df_new)
head(df1)
distance = dist(df1)
head(distance)
# TWCV Values for k+1  to K = 15
set.seed(123)
k <-1:15
twcv = function(k) 
kmeans(df1,centers = k,nstart = 10)$tot.withinss
#plot twcv for k = 1 to k = 10
twcv_values <- sapply(k,twcv)
head(twcv_values)
# Elbow chart
par(mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1)) # Reset the margins
plot(k,twcv_values,type ="b",pch = 19,
     xlab = "Number of Clusters K",ylab = "TWCV")
grid() # K = 4. The best value of k is 4. 

#Q2 Hierarchical Clustering
h1 = hclust(distance, method ='ward.D')
str(h1)
# Dendrogram - Ward
#
plot(h1,cex=0.4,xlab="",sub="",ylab="")
par(cex=0.4, mar=c(5, 8, 4, 8))
plot(as.dendrogram(h1),horiz=T)
# CUT the dendrograms to 4 clusters
cut1 = cutree(h1,k=4)
head(cut1)
df2 = data.frame(df1,cluster = cut1)
head(df2)
fviz_dend(h1,k=4,cex = 0.5, main="Ward linkage",
          k_colors = "jco", rect = T, rect_fill = T)

# scatterplot - Ward linkage
fviz_cluster(list(data = df, cluster = cut1),main="Ward linkage",
             palette = "Set2",show.clust.cent = F, labelsize = 10,
             repel = T, # Avoid label overplotting (slow) 
             ggtheme = theme_minimal()
              )

# cut dendrogram with average linkage
h2 = hclust(distance, method ='average')
cut2 = cutree(h2,k=4)
table(cut2)
#
# dendrogram - average linkage
#
fviz_dend(h2,k=4,cex = 0.5,main="average linkage",
          k_colors = "jco", rect = T, rect_fill = T)
#
# scatterplot - average linkage
#
fviz_cluster(list(data = df, cluster = cut2),main="average linkage",
             palette = "Set2",show.clust.cent = F, labelsize = 10,
             repel = T, # Avoid label overlap (slow) 
             ggtheme = theme_minimal() 
              )
```


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
